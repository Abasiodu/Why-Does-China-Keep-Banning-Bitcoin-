# üßê Why Does China Hate Crypto?

China has had a complicated and often antagonistic relationship with cryptocurrencies. Despite numerous bans and restrictions since 2013, crypto continues to survive in the country.

## üìú Key Historical Points

1. **Early Digital Currency (2005):**  
   - Tencent's QQ Coin was one of China's first digital currencies, but it quickly faced government crackdowns due to its potential to disrupt the financial system.
  
2. **Virtual Gold & Early Adoption (2009-2013):**  
   - Chinese citizens became involved in mining virtual gold in games like World of Warcraft.

3. **Initial Ban (2013):**

4. **Aggressive Regulations (2017-2018):**  
   - China banned ICOs and stopped crypto exchanges from serving Chinese residents, leading to an exodus of crypto exchanges from the country. Despite these efforts, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $20,000 in 2017.

5. **Mining Ban (2019):**

6. **The Fight Continues (2020-2021):**  
   - Despite several bans and aggressive measures, including a blanket ban on all mining and transactions, crypto showed resilience, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021.
